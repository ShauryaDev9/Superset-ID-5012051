Q. Explain the different types of linked lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List)

Types of Linked Lists

Singly Linked List:
Structure: Each node in a singly linked listing contains a records area and a reference (or hyperlink) to the next node inside the series.
Operations: Efficient in operations which include insertion and deletion at the beginning of the listing. However, looking or deleting a selected node calls for traversal from the pinnacle of the listing.
Advantages: Simple structure and clean to enforce. Requires less memory as compared to doubly related lists.

Doubly Linked List:
Structure: Each node includes a records discipline, a connection with the subsequent node, and a connection with the previous node.
Operations: Allows traversal in both ahead and backward instructions, making it simpler to carry out certain operations, together with deletion from the give up of the listing.
Advantages: More flexible in terms of traversal and manipulation but uses more memory due to the greater reference for the preceding node.
