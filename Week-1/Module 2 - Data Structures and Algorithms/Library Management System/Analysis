> Time Complexity Comparison

Linear Search:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Description: It checks each element one by one. Efficient for small datasets or unsorted lists.

Binary Search:
Time Complexity: O(log n)
Description: It repeatedly divides the list in half. Requires the list to be sorted. More efficient than linear search for large datasets.

> When to Use Each Algorithm

Use Linear Search:
When the dataset is small or unsorted.
When the list of books is dynamic and frequently modified.
When the order of elements does not matter.

Use Binary Search:
When the dataset is large and sorted.
When quick search operations are essential, and the list does not change frequently.
When performance is critical and the list can be maintained in a sorted order.
