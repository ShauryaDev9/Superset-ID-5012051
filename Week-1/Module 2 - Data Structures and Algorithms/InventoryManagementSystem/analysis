4. Analysis
Time Complexity:

    Add Operation: O(1) on average for HashMap as it uses a hash table.
    Update Operation: O(1) on average for HashMap as it involves updating an existing entry.
    Delete Operation: O(1) on average for HashMap as it involves removing an existing entry.

Optimization Strategies:

   1. HashMap Load Factor and Capacity: Adjusting the load factor and initial capacity of the HashMap can help optimize performance, especially when dealing with a very large inventory. This can reduce the likelihood of collisions and the need for resizing.
   2. Concurrency Handling: If the inventory system is accessed by multiple threads, consider using ConcurrentHashMap to handle concurrent modifications safely.
   3. Indexing: If searching by multiple attributes is required (e.g., product name or price), consider using additional data structures or indexes to improve search performance.
